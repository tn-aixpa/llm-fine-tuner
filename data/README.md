# DATA

The dataset used to train the chatbot are available in different configuration.

`AmiciFamiglia` and `Comuni` contain respectively dialogues on Piani Famiglia and generic administrative documents. Folders with `all` contain both.

All the 3 instances are provided in 2 versions. The first one contains the entire documents on which the dialogues are based on , while the `only ground` version is smaller and contains only the portions of documents relevant for the dialogue.
